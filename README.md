# Manifold Learning

We employ some different Manifold Learning Techniques (t-SNE, UMAP) to represent high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space.

The datasets are taken from:
* Mammoth: https://github.com/MNoichl/UMAP-examples-mammoth/blob/master/mammoth_a.csv

# UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation Procedure)
